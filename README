= PoolParty MRTG plugin

== NOTICE:
  Untested as of Feb 2nd. MRTG config still need tweaked for Ubuntu AMI. You
  have been warned! Should be ready for production testing this week.

== DESCRIPTION:
  Setup mrtg on poolparty easy as pie
  
== USAGE:
  Declare mrtg in your cloud block
    mrtg do
      monitor :cpu, :uptime, :free_memory, :processes, :snmp_network, :apache
    end

== Available Monitors
  * :cpu
  * :uptime
  * :free_memory
  * :processes
  * :snmp_network
  * :apache

== NOTICE:
  This should be considered pre-beta software. It enables smtp on your nodes.
  Please make sure you understand the security ramifications of doing this.

  Additionally, the scripts have only been tested in a production environment
  for a short time.

== BUGS:
  * Each individual unit of monitoring should become a virtual resource. This is
  a TODO

  * "ExtendedStatus On" needs to be manually added to an apache conf file to
    get apache monitoring

  * Would be nice to have snmp be optional and monitor most things via scripts
    that don't require it
