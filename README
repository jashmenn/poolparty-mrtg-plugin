= PoolParty MRTG plugin

== DESCRIPTION:
  Setup mrtg on poolparty easy as pie
  
== USAGE:
  Declare mrtg in your cloud block
    mrtg do
    end    

== EXAMPLE:
    mrtg do
      install
      install_extra_monitorings
    end

== Available Methods
  = install_extra_monitorings
    Installs a bunch of monitoring scripts and configs for you

== NOTICE:
  This should be considered pre-beta software. It enables smtp on your nodes.
  Please make sure you understand the security ramifications of doing this.

  Additionally, the scripts have only been tested in a production environment
  for a short time.

== BUGS:
  * Each individual unit of monitoring should become a virtual resource. This is
  a TODO

  * "ExtendedStatus On" needs to be manually added to an apache conf file to
    get apache monitoring
